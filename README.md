# Clearabee Tech Test

## Instructions

Thank you for you interest in the developer role at Clearabee. For this task, please follow the instructions below:

- Create a private repository in your **own** github account using this **[template](https://github.com/Clearabee/Tech-Test)**
- Create a new branch off the main branch
- Commit your work on the new branch, and push it to github
- Invite Naveed Ziarab, Head of Engineering, to collaborate on the project **[@Nav33d](https://github.com/Nav33d)**
- Create a pull request against the main branch and add Naveed as a reviewer

## Test

We ask that you complete the function _getDeliveryOptions_ in deliveryOptions.ts, so all tests pass in deliveryOptions.test.ts.

## Context

The test is based on a real situation we had to solve at Clearabee: we have a number of products with different delivery options. If a customer orders, for example, two products, then we must find matching delivery options for those products, so they can be delivered at the same time.

## Time

We know how time consuming tech tests can be, so we have intentionally designed this not to take more than a few hours. If you only complete part of the test, please submit what you have done, as **we are as interested in how you go about the task as we are in you completing it**.

## Install

`npm i`

## Tests

This runs the tests in watch mode, so they will run again any time a change is saved to deliveryOptions.ts.

`npm run test`

If you have any questions or issues, please do not hesitate to reach out to Naveed Ziarab at naveed.ziarab@clearabee.co.uk.

We look forward to discussing your submission with you.
